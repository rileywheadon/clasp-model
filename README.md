# clasp-model

This repository contains the code for my research on root zonation in _A. thaliana_.
I worked on this project between May 2024 and November 2024 with the support of [Dr. Eric Cytrynbaum](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml) (UBC Mathematics) and [Dr. Geoffrey Wasteneys](https://wasteneyslab.wixsite.com/ubcwasteneys) (UBC Botany).
My research was also funded by an [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp).

## Setup

To run the code, you will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.13.2 recommended). Then,

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rileywheadon/clasp-model.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the code: `python main.py`
